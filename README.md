# Employee Performance Analysis

This project aims to analyze a dataset related to employee performance, focusing on key factors such as job satisfaction, compensation, attrition, and other workplace-related attributes. The objective is to explore relationships among these factors and understand their impact on employee performance and attrition.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze the dataset to identify factors that contribute to employee attrition and job satisfaction.
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition.
- Visualize the data to gain insights into patterns and relationships.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, etc.
- **Job Information**: Department, Job Role, Job Level, Years at Company, etc.
- **Compensation**: Daily Rate, Monthly Income, Stock Option Level, etc.
- **Performance**: Job Satisfaction, Job Involvement, Performance Rating, etc.

The dataset has 34 columns with 1,470 rows, providing ample data for analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Identify and handle missing or null values.
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.
   - Standardize numerical features to ensure consistent scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate visualizations to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
   - Analyze relationships among variables using scatter plots, box plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.
3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Apply a machine learning model to predict employee attrition.
   - Train and test the model using a pipeline that includes data preprocessing and model training.
   - Evaluate the model's performance with metrics like accuracy and classification reports.
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create unique visualizations to gain insights into key relationships.
   - Use advanced visualizations like violin plots, stacked bar plots, and facet grids to explore data patterns.

## Visualizations
To understand the dataset, various visualizations were created, including:
- **Histograms**: To examine the distribution of numerical variables like 'Age' and 'DailyRate'.
- **Box Plots**: To explore the spread and outliers in data.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: To identify correlations among numerical variables.
- **Scatter Plots**: To understand relationships between pairs of numerical variables.
- **Violin Plots**: To visualize the distribution and density of a variable.
- **Stacked Bar Plots**: To compare categorical data with another categorical variable.

## Machine Learning
A machine learning pipeline was created to predict employee attrition:
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
- **Model Selection**: Chose a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression).
- **Model Training and Testing**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Trained the model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the test set.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy and classification reports.
